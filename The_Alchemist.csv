Originally written in Portuguese by the Brazilian writer Paulo Coelho, “ The Alchemist” is an allegorical novel 
about an Andalusian young shepherd who gets a dream that there is treasure in the pyramids of Egypt waiting for him. 
In his journey to find the treasure, he meets several people; one who buys his sheep, one who robs his money, one who 
is looking for an alchemist and also Fatima with whom he falls in love. It is his learning of the real treasure that 
makes this novel stand apart from other treasure-finding novels. Be sure to read it because I don’t want to spoil your 
fun by telling you about the ending. It is a short read so you can download the PDF version. But I would recommend the
paperback version because the novel can be re-read and is worthy of your book shelf.
